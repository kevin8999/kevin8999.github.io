However, this will not affect my review of this class.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom August 2025 to December 2025, I was enrolled in a class called \\"Man\'s Food.\\" Despite the name, I will refer to this class as a \\"nutrition class\\" because that is what stuck out to me the most about this class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Did I Take This Class?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much as I would love to say that I enrolled in it for the love of food, my primary reason for taking this class was because I needed General Education credits for my major (Computer Science!). Due to this fact, I was very skeptical with whether or not I would even enjoy this class because I don\'t really like biology-related content.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, after completing the entire course, I can confidently say that I enjoy this class now!\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Did I Know Before Taking This Class?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore taking this class, my general knowledge of \\"nutrition\\" was relatively general. I was aware that to eat healthy, one must eat a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy. But, I never paid too much attention to it because nutrition advice always seemed confusing. Prior to this class, nutrition advice seemed to be a long list of commandments that must be obeyed, unless you wanted to suffer long-term consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I can confidently say that this class has gotten rid a lot of confusion that I had regarding nutrition-related advice. It also has made me pay much more attention to what I eat and to eat healthier!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest reason for this is because the course requires you to build a meal plan of what you will eat during a given week. The assignment originally required me to use AI to generate a meal plan at first. However, I later refined it to better fit my needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## My Nutritional Needs\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan/\\r\\n\\r\\n## My Meal Plan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below shows the current meal plan that I follow every week.\\r\\n\\r\\n| Meal | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |\\r\\n|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|\\r\\n| **Breakfast** | Oats + Apple | Eggs + Toast | Oats + Apple | Eggs + Toast | Oats + Apple | Cereal + Milk + Apple | Apple |\\r\\n| **Lunch**     | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Restaurant |\\r\\n| **Dinner**    | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce |  |"},{"id":"/first post","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first post","source":"@site/blog/first post.md","title":"My first post","description":"Hello world 2025-08-07","date":"2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.01,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"My first post","description":"Hello world 2025-08-07","date":"2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Nutrition Class Review","permalink":"/blog/Nutrition Class Review"}},"content":"Welcome to the blog."}]}}')}}]);
