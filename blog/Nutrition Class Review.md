# Nutrition Class Review

:::note 
This blog post was written as an assignment for this class. However, this will not affect my review of this class.

From August 2025 to December 2025, I was enrolled in a class called "Man's Food." Despite the name, I will refer to this class as a "nutrition class" because I learned a lot about nutrition and healthy eating.

## Why Did I Take This Class?

As much as I would love to say that I enrolled in it for the love of food, the main reason I took this class was because I needed General Education credits for my Computer Science degree. Initially, I was very skeptical with whether or not I would even enjoy this class because biology-related content tends to be boring for me.

However, after completing the entire course, I can confidently say I enjoy this class now!

## What Did I Know Before Taking This Class?

Before taking this class, my general understanding of nutrition was relatively basic. I was aware that to eat healthy, one must eat a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy. But, I never put too much thought towards it because nutrition advice always seemed confusing. Nutrition always felt like a long list of complicated rules that must be obeyed, unless you wanted to suffer long-term consequences. Because of this, I never really bothered to stay informed on how to eat healthy even though I knew an unhealthy diet that it was affecting me in negative ways.

## What Have I Learned?

This class cleared up a lot of confusion I had about nutrition and helped me understand why certain recommendations exist. It also made me much more intentional about what I eat.

One of the most useful things I learned was the [MyPlate Plan](https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan/). The MyPlate Plan asks users for their age, height, weight, and typical exercise and presents them with a list of daily recommended amounts.

Before this course, I assumed that 2,000 calories was the “standard” for everyone (except for athletes). After entering my information into the tool, I discovered I actually needed about 2,800 calories per day, along with:

- 2.5 cups of fruit
- 3.5 cups of vegetables
- 10 ounches of grain
- 7 ounches of protein
- 3 cups of dairy

Seeing these numbers laid out made it much easier to understand where my diet was unbalanced. I realized I was overeating grains while consistently falling short on vegetables and dairy.

I also learned an important food-safety rule: avoid storing food in the 40°-140°F range because bacteria reproduce the quickest at these temperature ranges. Before, I thought that you should only store food below a certain temperature to ensure that it is safe to eat.

Another major takeaway was the value of meal planning. Meal planning is where you plan what to eat in advance. Before, I would buy food and cook whatever was convenient. However, planning meals in advance completely changed that. It helped me eat healthier, waste less food, and stay consistent. Meal planning is the most impactful thing I learned from this course.

In the next section, I will show you my meal plan.

### My Meal Plan

The most impactful part about this course is that it requires you to build a meal plan of what you will eat during a given week. The assignment originally required me to use AI to generate a meal plan at first. However, I later refined it to better fit my needs.

Here is the meal plan I currently follow:

| Meal | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Breakfast** | Oats + Apple | Eggs + Toast | Oats + Apple | Eggs + Toast | Oats + Apple | Cereal + Milk + Apple | Apple |
| **Lunch**     | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Ham + Veggies | Rice + Chicken + Veggies | Restaurant |
| **Dinner**    | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | Pasta + Tomato Sauce | None |

There’s still room for improvement (for example, adding more dairy and vegetables on certain days), but this is a massive upgrade from my old routine of spaghetti with the occasional salad.

After using this meal plan, I noticed that I felt better mentally, which made it easier to focus on lectures and assignments. I also had an easier time studying too. It also saves me a lot of time because I only cook twice a week now!

## Conclusion

This class gave me more than just information about nutrition. It ended up changing how I eat. I’m now much more aware of whether my meals actually meet my nutritional needs instead of guessing. The MyPlate Plan gives me a clear numbers to shoot for, and the meal plan gives me a system that I can adjust as my schedule or goals change. I also pay more attention to food safety, portion balance, and whether I’m getting enough vegetables and dairy. Moving forward, I plan to keep refining my meal plan so it stays realistic and balanced. Thanks to this class, I no longer see nutrition as a list of rules. Instead, I see it that, if used correctly, directly improves my focus, energy, and overall quality of life.
