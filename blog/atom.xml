<p>From August 2025 to December 2025, I was enrolled in a class called "Man's Food." Despite the name, I will refer to this class as a "nutrition class" because that is what stuck out to me the most about this class.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="why-did-i-take-this-class">Why Did I Take This Class?<a href="https://kevin8999.github.io/blog/Nutrition%20Class%20Review#why-did-i-take-this-class" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Did I Take This Class?" title="Direct link to Why Did I Take This Class?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As much as I would love to say that I enrolled in it for the love of food, my primary reason for taking this class was because I needed General Education credits for my major (Computer Science!). Due to this fact, I was very skeptical with whether or not I would even enjoy this class because I don't really like biology-related content.</p>
<p>However, after completing the entire course, I can confidently say that I enjoy this class now!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="what-did-i-know-before-taking-this-class">What Did I Know Before Taking This Class?<a href="https://kevin8999.github.io/blog/Nutrition%20Class%20Review#what-did-i-know-before-taking-this-class" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What Did I Know Before Taking This Class?" title="Direct link to What Did I Know Before Taking This Class?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Before taking this class, my general knowledge of "nutrition" was relatively general. I was aware that to eat healthy, one must eat a balanced diet of vegetables, fruits, grains, proteins, and dairy. But, I never paid too much attention to it because nutrition advice always seemed confusing. Prior to this class, nutrition advice seemed to be a long list of commandments that must be obeyed, unless you wanted to suffer long-term consequences.</p>
<p>However, I can confidently say that this class has gotten rid a lot of confusion that I had regarding nutrition-related advice. It also has made me pay much more attention to what I eat and to eat healthier!</p>
<p>The biggest reason for this is because the course requires you to build a meal plan of what you will eat during a given week. The assignment originally required me to use AI to generate a meal plan at first. However, I later refined it to better fit my needs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="my-nutritional-needs">My Nutritional Needs<a href="https://kevin8999.github.io/blog/Nutrition%20Class%20Review#my-nutritional-needs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My Nutritional Needs" title="Direct link to My Nutritional Needs" translate="no">​</a></h2>

<p>The table below shows the current meal plan that I follow every week.</p>
