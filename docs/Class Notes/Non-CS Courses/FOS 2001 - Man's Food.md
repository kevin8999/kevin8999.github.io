# FOS 2001 - Man's Food

## Module 1
### Food Selection
Major criteria for food selection

1. Sensory reasons: how food looks
2. Nutrition
3. Budget
4. Psychological reasons
5. Sociological reasons
6. Culture and religion

Sensory criterium

- sight
- odor
- taste
- touch
- hearing

Sensory criteria (can be deceiving)

- shape
- color
- size
- texture
- shine
- defects

Odor: just as important as sight

- carried by volatile molecules in gas form
- described by term "olfactory"

Taste

- most influential factor
- detected by taste buds
- affected by
	- age
	- genetics
	- food solubility
- types of taste
	- sweet
	- sour
	- bitter
	- salty
	- umami (savory)
	- oleogustus (fat. proposed term)
- described by term "gustatory"

Touch

- gives info about texture
- gives info about other objects

Hearing

- helps evaluate food quality
- i.e.: fizz sound of open soda can

Nutritional criteria

- relationship between diet and health
- weight management
- health conditions

Cultural and religious criteria

- determines food acceptability
- affects manners

Psychological and social factors

- emotional eating
- ads
- social conscience (i.e. peer pressure)

Budget

- limits food purchases
- determines type of foods/brands
- determines eating out habits

### Nutritional Assessment

Nutritional status: degree that one's diet meets nurtritional requirements

Malnutrition: poor state of nutrition

- Undernutrition: not getting enough (deficiency)
- Overnutrition: too much nutrition (toxicity)

Overnutrition and undernutrition are both states of malnutrition

Primary: caused by eating too much or too little
Secondary: caused by other factors like disease

Adequate amounts of nutrients are different for each person
- sex
- age
- physical activity
- genetics

Nutritional assessment

- anthropometric measurement: body's physical dimensions and composition
- biochemical measurement: biomarkers (blood, urine, etc.)
- clinical assessment: medical history in clinical setting
- dietary assessment: record and analysis of food and drink consumption

Nutritional requirements differ in different people

- needs can be determined by reference values

### Food Guidance Systems

Tools to simplify diet assessment (food guidance systems)

many US gov agencies help ensure national health

- Dietary Guidelines for Americans (USDA/HHS)
- USDA MyPlate

USDA Food Guides

- classifies nutritionally similar foods into "food groups"
- reflects scientific knowledge and socio-economic circumstance
- has 5 major food groups
	- fruits
	- grains
	- vegetables
	- protein
	- dairy

USDA Food Guides have changed over time

- i.e. during Great Depression, economically cheap food was suggested

Dietary Guidelines for Americans

- published every 5 years (started in 1980)
- published by HHS and USDA
- reflects current science and provide advice to promote health

2020-25 dietary guidelines

- 4 overarching guidelines
- focused on eating patterns and food/nutrient characteristics
- healthy eating is customizable

overarching guidelines

1. follow healthy dietary pattern at every life stage
2. customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations
3. focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods/beverages within calorie limits
4. limit food and beverages high in added sugars, saturated fat, sodium. limit alcoholic beverages

Nutrient-dense food (small choices add up!): provides same or more nutrients with fewer calories

- frosted shredded wheat vs plain shredded
- full fat yogurt vs plain low fat yogurt with fruit
- regular canned beans vs low sodium beans
- butter vs vegetable oil
- etc.

85-15 guide

- 85% of calories needed per day should come from nurient-dense foods
- 15% can be used for other purposes (i.e. added sugars and saturated fats)

3 USDA food patterns

- US style
- vegetarian
- Mediterrenean

USDA MyPlate illustrates DGA recommendations. Contains 5 food groups

- fruits
- vegetables
- grains
- protein
- dairy

### Food Guide and Dietary Assessment

Food guidance systems tell you:

- how many calories to take
- what kinds of food to eat
- how much food to eat

Dietary assessment can tell you

- if diet meets energy and nutrient needs
- if you take nutrients from all food groups

Food tracking tools

- https://myfitnesspal.com
- https://mynetdiary.com
- https://cronometer.com
- ASA24 Dietary Assessment Tool (demo site for personal use)
	- https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/asa24/

Nutrient data resources

- USDA FoodData Central
- Very Well Fit (recipe analyzer)
- Happy Forks (diet analysis and food diary)
- CalorieKing (restaurant food database)

Keeping food records: track everything you eat and drink for at least 1 day (ideally, for 3 days)

1. Detail is important
2. estimate/measure seriving size accurately
3. choose representative "normal" days
4. do not change normal eating patterns!!

### Food Labeling

All food products should have

- product name
- net weight/counts
- name and address of manufacturer
- ingredient list
- nutrition labeling
- allergy labeling

Nutrition facts label

1. Serving information: number of servings in container and serving size
2. Calories: shows calories per saving
3. Nutrients: contains nutrients to get less of and more of
	- nutrients you should get less of: saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and sugars. It is recommended to stay *below* 100% daily value
	- nutrients you should get more of: dietary fiber, Vitamin D, calcium, iron, potassium
		- aim to get 100% of these values on most days

Daily value (DV) - general guide

- 5% or less is low
- 20% or more is high
- for trans fat and protein, use the gram amounts. 5-20 rule still applies

Label only considers what someone that eats 2k calories per day would need

Nutrient content claims are regulated by the FDA

Health claims: describes potential health benefits of nutrient/ingredient in a food product

- must be approved by FDA
- two types
	- pre-approved health claims: well-established
	- qualified health claims: less established. disclaimer required

## Learning Culture Through Recipes
### Food as Cultural Identity

Why food matters

- more than just a means of sustenance
- also signifies heritage, traditions, and communal bonds

Cuisine: cultural traditions of cooking and eating

Food reflects cultural values, history, and geography

Food choices are influenced by:

- food available in region
- food we ate in the past
- food we shared with friends and family

Example: Kimchi, French Baguette

Feasting and festivals

- birthdays, weddings, holidays
- reinforces cultural bonds
- creates a sense of community

Spices, herbs, and flavors

- historical influence: trade routes, colonization
- geographical impact: local climates
- cultural and religious significance
- culinary techniques
- festive traditions

Fusion cuisine: blends culinary traditions from different cultures

- influenced by migration
- leads to cultural exchange
- creates diversity and creativity

Summary

- Food is integral to cultural identity reflects heritage, history, and values
- traditions, ingredients, and rituals shape individual and collective identities and reflect history and geography

## Food Composition
### Intro to Food Composition
All food and people are made of the same materials

- Nitrogen
- Carbon
- Hydrogen
- Oxygen
- Phosphorus
- Sulfur

Some contain organic compounds (contains carbon) or inorganic compounds (does not contain carbon).

6 basic nutrient groups

- Protein
- Lipids
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Water
- Carbohydrates

Human body composition

- Water: 60-70%
- Fat: 15-25% (varies)
- Protein: 15%
- Minerals: 12%

Energy-yielding nutrients

- Carbohydrate (4 kcal/g)
- Protein (4 kcal/g)
- Fat (9 kcal/g)
- Alcohol (7 kcal/g)

Non-energy-yielding nutrients

- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Water
- Indigestible fiber

Nutrients are the foundatiosn of all living organisms

- right amount of nutrients are needed for growth and maintenance of body

Summary

- food and body share same key elements
- 6 basic nutrient groups in food
- nutrients are critical for health

### Water
Water is one of 6 basic nutrient groups

- Water formula: $\text{H}_2\text{O}$.
- Losing just 10% of our body's water is fatal.
- Water can exist in either free or bound form
- bound water is not readibly available for reactions. connected to other molecules

Change of water state

- solid: ice. water molecules lined up closely together
- liquid: water. water molecules move away from each other but do not escape each other
- gas: steam. water molecules move so far apart that they can escape each other

Functions of water in food

- heat transfer
- solvent: dissolving stuff like salt and sugar
- agent in chemical reactions
- effect on food preservation

food preservation and water

- water activity ($a_w$): measure of amount of available (free) water in foods. Ranges from 0 to 1
- bound water cannot be used for chemical reactions, so they're not useful for sustaining life
- pure water is when $a_w=1$
- bacteria cannot grow in food with $a_w \leq 0.85$
- water activity is different from moisture content
- the lower $a_w$ is, the longer food can be stored without spoilage
	- example: dry milk powder can be stored longer than fresh milk because its $a_w$ is less than fresh milk

Adding solutes (sugar, salt) can lower water activity and inhibit microbial growth

Summary

- water is vital but doesn't produce energy
- free and bound water is not the same. It impacts the potential for reactions
- water activity affects food preservation
- water has various roles in food preparation

### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates is a macronutrient. Provides energy for body

There are 4 macronutrients (needed in large amounts)

- carbohydrates. energy-producing
- proteins. energy-producing
- lipids. energy-producing
- water

There are 2 micronutrients (needed in small amounts)

- vitamins
- minerals

Most common carbs

- sugars
- starches
- fats

common food sources

- grains
- legumes
- fruits
- some vegetables (i.e. potatoes, onions)

The type of carbohydrate is more important than the amount consumed. Some sources are more healthy than others

Chemistry of carbs

- formula: $(\text{CH}_2\text{O})_n$ where $n$ is the number of molecules
- contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen

Carbohydrates can be classified into:

- monosaccharides
	- hexoses (6-C atoms)
		- glucose: most common and major blood sugar. unit of starch and glycogen
		- fructose: "fruit sugar". sweetest sugar
		- galactosepart of milk sugar (lactose)
	- pentose (5-C atoms)
		- ribose
		- arabinose
- disaccharides
	- sucrose: glucose + fructose. Used a lot in food
	- maltose: glucose + glucose 
	- lactose: glucose + galactose
- polysaccharides
	- digestible
		- starch (plants): synthesized by photosynthesis
			- amylose (chain)
			- amylopectin (branched)
		- glycogen (animals)
	- indigestible
		- fiber: found only in foods with plants
			- example: cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums, inulin
- Oligosaccharides: in between disaccharide and polysaccharides

`-saccharide` depends on the number of carbon in each molecular unit.

- mono=1
- di=2
- poly= more than 2

Lactose intolerance: inability to digest lactose due to lack of lactase enzyme to break down lactose

Cellulose is not digestible so it doesn't provide energy

Functions of carbohydrates

- sweetness
- viscosity
- bulk
- solubility
- color (browning)
- texture

Summary

- carbohydrates: essential macronutrients for energy
- different types of carbs exist
- role: sweetness, texture, thickness, and color

### Lipids
Lipids are a major source of energy

- fats: lipids that are solid at room temperature
- oils: lipids that are liquid at room temperature

Chemistry of lipids

- composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
- major lipids
	- fatty acids
	- triglycerides
	- phospholipids
	- sterols
	- fat-soluble vitamins

fatty acid: most common type of lipid

- contains methyl (or omega) end & a carbolixylic acid (or alpha) end
- contains hydrocarbon backbone that connects the omega and alpha ends

Fatty acid characteristics

- length: determined by number of carbon atoms
- saturation: determined by number of double bonds between two carbon atoms (-C=C-)

Fatty acid

- saturated fat: no double bonds
- monounsaturated: one double bond
- polyunsaturated: two or more double bonds

saturated fat sources: meat, poultry, milk/butter/cheese, yolk lard

Cis fatty acid: hydrogens are on the same side on the double bonded carbons
Trans fatty acid: hydrogens are on the opposite sides of each other on the double bonded carbons

Phospholipids: component of cell membrane

- glycerol + 2 fatty acids + polar head group
- contains polar (hyrdophilic) and non-polar (hydrophobic)
- emulsifier: compound containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties

Sterols: large molecules with interconnected carbon rings

- i.e. cholesterol

Functions of lipids in foods

- heat transfer medium
- emusifying: prevent food and water from separating
- tenderness
- flavor

Summary

- lipids are macronutrients. 9 kcal/g
- types of lipids include fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols

## Food Safety
### Food Safety Overview
Terms

 - Food safety: protection of food from natural contamination - 
 - Food defense: protection of food from intentional contamination 
 - Food security: availability of food and access to food
 - Food quality: acceptability of food characteristics

Foodborne illness: caused by consuming contaminated foods or beverages

- >250 foodborne diseases have been identified
- costs $10 billion in economic damage
- 1 in 6 Americans (roughly) get foodborne illnesses
- many hospitalizations and deaths from foodborne illnesses are unknown. this is because no one accurately recalls what they ate. also takes time to identify too

Foodborne illness symptoms

- diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- flu-like symptoms (fever, headache)
- can lead to serious illness or death
- onset of symptoms can vary btwn 30 minutes to weeks. usually takes 12-72 hours

High-risk groups: infants and young children, pregnant women, elderly, and ppl with weakened immune systems

Causes of foodborne illnesses

- biological hazards: bacteria, viruses, parasites. biggest threat but most can be killed through cooking
- chemical hazards: chemicals, toxins, heavy metals
- physical hazards: wood, glass, plastic, bone, metal, etc.
- radiological hazards: radioactive materials

Most common causes of foodborne illnesses

- Norovirus
- Salmonella
- Clostridium perfringens
- Campylobactor spp.
- Staphylococcus aureus

Relatively speaking, death rates are low for these diseases, but they still kill hundreds per year

Transmission of pathogens to food

- personal hygiene failure
- time/temperature abuse
- cross-contamination

Prevention of foodborne illnesses

1. Clean: wash hands, utensils, and surfaces
2. Separate: don't cross-contaminate
3. Cook: cook to right temperature. Check internal temperature
4. Chill: refrigerate properly. Bacteria grows quickly between 40-140F

Challenges in food safety

- new pathogens can emerge quickly
- known pathogens can be associated with new foods
- complexity of global food supply

Summary

- foodborne illness is caused by biological, chemical, physical, and radiological hazards
- preventive steps: clean, separate, cook, and chill
- global food supply increases tracking challenges

### Food Safety Hazards

Foodborne illnesses are a major problem

- 48 million cases of foodborne illness in 2011
- 128,000 hospitalized
- 3000 deaths
- 10-83 billion dollars in economic damage

3 main types of biological hazards

- bacteria
- viruses
- parasites

### Control of Food Safety Hazards

What will be covered

- simple way to think about food and how it relates to food safety
- review FATTOM: simple way to control biological hazards

To control bacterial growth, use FATTOM

- Food: bacteria must have suitable food supply to grow. Most bacteria prefer foods high in protein
- Acid: most foods are acidic (pH < 7.0). Very acidic foods (i.e. lemons, limes, tomatoes) will not support growth of disease-causing bacteria. Pickling fruits and vegetables preserves food by adding acids (such as vinegar and citric acid)
- Temperature
	- growth temperature:
		- psychrophiles: 0-20 C
		- mesophiles: 20-45 C
		- thermophiles: 45 C
	- danger zone: 40-140 F
- Time:
	- bacteria can double every 15-30 minutes (under ideal conditions). Some can double every 10 minutes
	- one bacterium dividing every 10 minutes could multiply to over 500 million in 5 hours
- Oxygen
	- aerobic bacteria: requires oxygen to live
	- anaerobic: requires environment free of oxygen
	- facultative anaerobic bacteria: grows without or without oxygen
	- microaerophilic: requires oxygen, but only a small amount (around 5%)
- Moisture
	- water activity: measures amount of water not bound by food
	- earliest forms of food preservation (drying and salting) reduces amount of available water needed for growth

Summary

- almost every product and process needs to take into account microbial implications
- knowing product is key to understanding its potential microbial hazards and pitfalls

### Food Allergies

Food allergy: immune response to certain food or food ingredient

- very common. affects 5% of adults and 8% of children

	- protected by thin coating (cuticle or bloom)
	- contains inner and outer membranes
- air cell
	- pocket of air space
	- forms when freshly laid egg cools and contracts
	- between two membranes (outer and inner)
	- grows larger as egg ages

Regulation of eggs

- regulated by FDA
- egg products are regulated by USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service
- grading of eggs is done by USDA AMS. grading is voluntary

Grading of eggs

- AA: egg will stand up tall, yolk is firm, and area is covered by white is small. Large proportion of thick white to thin white
- A: covers relatively small area. yolk is round and upstanding. thick white is large in proportion to thin white
- B: spreads out more. yolk is flattened and is much more thin white than thick white

Grading of eggs

- Candling: examining eggs placed against light
- Measuring Haugh by cracking
	- crack an egg onto a flat surface
	- measure the height of thick albumen
	- Haugh unit is mathematically calculated

Nutrition of eggs: excellent source of many nutrients

- Protein: high quality protein
- Fat: in yolk (triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids)
- Vitamins: contains all fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) in yolk and B vitamins in egg white
- Minerals: good sources of minerals (selenium, iodine, zinc)

Function of eggs in foods
- Emulsifying: lecithin in yolk is natural emulsifier. Keeps fat and water separate
- binding: coagulated egg proteins act as adhesive, binding other ingredients together
- foaming: egg white foams aerate and leaven many food products
- interfering: blocks formation of large ice crystals or sugar crystals
- color: golden brown color in various food products

Egg safety

- fresh eggs are frequently linked to foodborne illnesses
- 79k illnesses and 30 deaths are associated with egg consumption
- salmonella is most common pathogen

Egg safety practices

- buy refrigerated eggs only
- buy clean, uncracked eggs
- cook eggs until both yolk and eggwhite are firm, not runny
- casseroles and other egg-containing dishes should be cooked to 160 F
- recipes that need raw eggs, use pasteurized eggs

summary

- eggs have 4 main components: yolk, albumen, air cell, and shell
- eggs are nutrient-dense and provide high-quality protein

	- water can make susceptible to spoilage
	- wash right before eating!

## Grains

### Cereal Grains

Cereal grains

- seeds from grass family
- we've been eating them for thousands of years
- may have been eating as early as 8000 BCE
- major food crops with numerous variety
- corn, rice, wheat make up 90% of world's production
- barley, sorghum, oats, and rye make up the rest of the 10%

Composition of grains

- husk: rough protective cover that protects grain from environmental damage and pests
- bran: hard outer layer of grain. rich in fiber and minerals
- endosperm: largest portion containing starch
- germ: plant embryo. rich in fat, minerals, and vitamins

products from cereal grains

- flour: fine powder from endosperm
	- can be made from any grain but usually made from wheat. What is preferred because it has lots of protein
- pasta: extruded product made with flour starch and water
- breakfast cereal: ready-to-eat cereals (cold) and hot cereals (needs water or milk)
- alcoholic beverages: made from fermentation of grains

General classification

- whole grain: contains bran, germ, and endosperm
- refined grain: contains endosperm only. less nutritious, but lasts longer than whole grain

Nutrition of cereal grains

- high in complex carbs
- good source of fiber (whole grains)
- USDA MyPlate recommends at least half of grain consumption comes from whole grains
- low in fat and contains no cholesterol
- vitamins and minerals in husk, bran, and germ

Changes during cooking

- gelatinization: process where heated starch molecules absorb water and expand
	- needs water (hydration) and heating
	- improves flavor and texture of grain
- 

Storage of cereal grains

- dry grains (without bran and germ) can be stored in cool, dry place for 6-12 months
-  whole grains are better kept refrigerated for long-term storage
- cooked grains should be refrigerated or frozen

### Flour

Flours

- fine powder made from endosperm of cereal grains
- wheat flour is most common flour
- most baked products have common flour mixture (flour, water, milk, fat, eggs, sugar, leavening agents)
- flour has two important components: starch and gluten

Gluten

- group of proteins in grains (wheat, barley, and rye)
- important in structure of baked products
- combination of gliadin (fluidity) and gluetenin (elastic)
- gluten traps water and gases in the 
- allows a baked product to rise
	- the more gluten, the better the baked product rises
	- gluten can expand as trapped gases expand

Gluten formation

- hydration: wets flour proteins. gliadin and glutenin forms gluten network
- kneading
	- increases gluten development
	- evenly distributes yeast and air
	- increases fermentation

Celiac disease

- disease where body creates antibodies against gluten. causes inflammation of intestinal wall. inhibits nutrient absorption in intestine
- people with celiac disease have serious problems when consuming gluten
- gluten-free is not better for those who do not have celiac disease

wheat flour classification

flour,protein
gluten,41%
whole wheat (hard),14%
durum wheat (hard),13%
bread (hard),11%
all-purpose,10%
pastry (soft),9%
cake,8%

flour mixture ingredients

- leavening agents: creates gases that causes the dough to rise
	- physical: air, steam
		- air is introduced during mixing or sifting
		- water in flour mixture produces steam
	- biological: yeast, bacteria
		- yeast generates carbon dioxide by fermenting sugars
	- chemical: baking soda and baking powder
		- baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) produces carbon dioxide in presence of water and acid. acidic ingredient is needed
		- baking powder: baking soda with acid, so no acidic ingredient is not needed
- sugar, salt
- flavoring
- fat, liquid (milk), eggs

Leavening: enhances baked product's volume, texture, and flavor. Makes wheat products pleasant to eat

## Dairy

### Milk

Composition of milk

- Milk fat (butterfat): contributes to flavor and mouthfeel
	- 66% saturated fats
- Carbohydrate (lactose)
- Proteins
	- casein (80% of milk)
	- whey (lactabumin, lactoglobulin)
- Vitamins A, D, riboflavin ($\text{B}_2$)
- vitamin A and D fortification is used in all milk (so all milk has vitamin A and D added to it)
	- fortification of (adding) vitamins A and D is optional but most milk processors add it anyways
	- vitamin A fortification not required for whole milk
- minerals: calcium

Protein,16%
Vitamin A,10%
Thiamin (B1),6%
Riboflavin (B2),20%
Niacin,1%
Calcium,30%
Iron,0.5%

Calorie content of milk varies. Mainly depends on fat content and additives

Milk Processing

1. Pasteurization: preservation process that heats liquids (milk, juices) to mild temperature (up to 212F) to destroy pathogens and spoilage microorganisms
	- also inactivates enzymes that cause rancidity
	- significantly reduces risk of illness but doesn't eliminate all organisms
	- ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) processing: milk is treated at much higher temp (280-302F)
		- kills more bacteria
		- increases shelf-life (can be stored unrefirgerated up to 3 months)
2. Homogenization: process that breaks up fat globules in milk into smaller globules
	- prevents separation of water and fat
	- doesn't change nutrient content but does change how it feels in your mouth

Milk grades: based on bacterial count (contains grades A and B)

- grade A is only used for drinking. Grade B is used for processing

types of milk

- whoel milk
- reduced fat (2% fat)
- low fat (1% fat)
- fat-free
- evaporated milk
- sweetened condensed milk: evaporating milk then adding sugar
- nonfat dry milk: remove all moisture from milk
- lactose-free milk: milk is treated with stuff like enzymes to filter out lactose
- plant-based milk
	- soy milk
	- rice milk
	- almond milk
	- coconut milk

changes during preparation

- flavor can change based on
	- heat, sunlight, and oxidation of milk
	- cow's diet
- coagulation: proteins coagulate to form solid clot (curd)
	- heat, acid, and enzymes can cause coagulation
	- coagulation used to create yogurt and cheese

milk safety

- raw milk (unpasteurized milk): associated with foodborne illnesses
- consume pasteurized milk only
- keep milk and milk products in the fridge

summary

- milk is a great source of protein, calcium, and vitamins A and D
- categorized based on fat content
- pasteurization is needed for milk safety

## Cheese

cheese is made from curd (solid portion of milk)

cheese classification (more than 2000 types of cheese)

- source of milk
- moisture content
- appearance
- ripening method
- place of origin

moisture content

- fresh: >80% moisture content
- soft: 50-75% moisture content
- semi-hard: 40-50% moisture content
- hard: 30-40% moisture content
- very hard: 30% or less moisture content

The lower the moisture content, the longer the aging is

production of cheese

1. milk selection
	- can influence cheese classification based on source of milk (cow, goat, sheep) and amount of fat (whole, 2%, 1%, fat-free)
	- hard cheesed aged for at least 60 days at >= 35F can be made into cheese
2. coagulation: clotting of casein protein to form curd
	- add enzyme OR
	- add acid
		- direct: add acid
		- indirect: add bacterial cultures that will create an acidic environment
	- enzyme coagulation (chymosin). quick. makes firm, rubbery curd
	- acid coagulation
3. Curd treatment: splits into
	- cutting: slicing curd
	- heating: whey evaporation and microorganism elimination
	- salting: further dehydration and flavor/texture
	- knitting: uniting curd into solid mass
	- pressing: pressing curds into compact mass in containers
	- solid portion (cheese curd)
	- liquid portion (whey)
4. Ripening (aka aging)
	- ranges from weeks to years
	- longer aging leads to harder cheeses
	- develops flavor, aroma, and texture

primary nutrients of cheese

- 1 lb of cheese's protein = 1 gallon of milk's protein
- highly nutrient-dense
- 1 oz of cheese = about 100 kcal
- fat: flavor and texture. primarily consists of saturated fats
- protein: contains all essential amino acids
- vitamins: fat soluble vitamins A and D
- minerals: calcium

Whey and Whey Products

- contains whey proteins, lactose, water-soluble vitamins, and minerals
- low in fat and rich in nutrients
- highly perishable
- pasteurized and processed

grading of cheese

- done by USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
- based on flavor, texture, color, and appearance
- 4 US grades: AA, A, B, and C

cheese safety

- soft cheeses are associated with Listeria (food-borne pathogen)
- consume only cheese from pasteurized milk
- keep cheese in refrigerator

## Yogurt and Ice Cream

Yogurt

- cultured, fermented milk product
	- ferment lactose to lactic acid
	- lactic acid bacteria inoculated to milk
	- acid: causes casein to precipitate out
- bacterial culture influences flavor, acidity, and texture of product

yogurt processing

- raw milk
- pasteurization and homogenization
- cooling
- bacteria is added
- mixing
- fermentation
- cooling

frozen desserts

- ice cream: made by freezing pasteurized mixture of milk, cream, and flavorings and sweetners
- gelato: less cream and more milk than ice cream
- frozen yogurt
- sherbet: fruit-based. contains milk and cream (small amount)
- sorbet: non-dairy
- water ices: non-dairy

Ice cream

- prepped by mixing and freezing
- dairy ingredients: milk, cream, milk fat, MSNF
- non-dairy ingredients: sweeteners, stabilizers, eggs, emulsifiers, flavors
- US standard of identity: must contain at least 10% milk fat and MSNF

Ice cream

- premium ice cream has higher milk fat (up to 20%)
- low-fat ice cream contains more sugar than milk and less fat than standard ice cream

ice cream

- low-fat: \<7% milk fat
- premium ice cream: 14% milk fat
- super-premium ice cream: 16-18% milk fat

calorie control

- frozen desserts are high-calorie (300 kcal per cup)
- control your portion
- watch your toppings

factors affecting quality

- flavor: flavor should be strong before freezing
- texture: smooth texture is preferred
	- smoothness depends on size of ice crystals. smaller and more evenly distributed crystals leads to smoother and creamier texture
	- rapid freezing and proper storage temp is critical
- body
	- stabilizers produce smooth texture by preventing large ice crystals from forming
	- overrun: increase of volume by pumping air into frozen dessert during freezing
	- ice cream with lower overrun and higher fat content is classified as premium

ice cream production

1. heating: pasteurization and homogenization
2. aging
3. add flavor and color
4. churning and freezing
5. packaging and hardening

storage of ice cream

- best stored at 0F or -18C
- quality can change during storage
	- absorption of odors from other foods
	- formation of large ice crystals

## Fats, Oils, and Sweets
### Fats and Oils
Consume in moderation

sources of fats

- animals (butter)
- plant seeds: safflower, sunflower, sesame, corn, olive, and others
- Nuts: peanuts and tree nuts
- Fruits: avocado and coconut

Functions of fats in food

- emulsions
- heat transfer
- shortening
- plasticity
- texture
- appearance
- satiety
- flavor

most fats are triglycerides

emulsions: liquids dispersed in another liquid, which is usually immiscible

- two types:
	- oil-in-water
	- water-in-oil
- 3 components
	- dispersed phase (discontinuous)
	- dispersion medium (continuous phase)
	- emulsifier
- example: oil and water don't mix. an emulsifier makes them mix

mechanism of emulsifier

- emulsifier has a hydrophilic and hydrophobic end
- in oil-in-water emulsion, hydrophilic end sticks out towards water. hydrophobic end sticks in towards oil
- in water-in-oil emulsion, hydrophobic end sticks out towards oil. hydrophilic sticks in towards water

melting points of fats are determined by

1. Length of fatty acid chain
	- fatty acid is made of carbyoxlyic end ($\alpha$) and methyl or omega end ($\omega$) and fatty acid chain of carbons and hydrogens
	- longer fatty acid chain = higher melting point
2. degree of saturation
	- saturated fatty acids = higher melting point
3. cis/trans configuration of double bonds
	- trans fatty acid = higher melting point
4. crystalline structure of fat
	- $\alpha$ crystal (random): fine, least stable, lowest melting point
	- $\beta'$ crystals (alternating rows at right angles): smooths surface (best for baking)
	- $\beta$ crystals (parallel rows): coarse/brittle. highest melting point

Oil production (2 steps)

1. Extraction
	- Cold-pressing: mechanical pressing (e.g. specialty)
	- Expeller-pressing: pressing at very high pressure and temperature
	- Chemical solvents
2. Refining: remove impurities and volatile components

Oils with high saturated fats

- used to be popular
- have longer shelf life
- tropical oils
	- coconut oils
	- palm oil
- no double bonds
	- breaks down less easily
	- more resistant to rancidity
- increases risk of coronary heart disease

hydrogenated oil

- hydrogenation: process of adding hydrogen atoms to double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids
- creates more trans fats than cis fats
- partially hydrogenated oil (PHO) was removed from FDA's GRAS (generally recognized as safe) list in 2015

reducing fat consumption

- choose healthier fats
	- reduce saturated and trans fat
	- choose unsaturated fats
- choose less-fat dependent cooking methods
	- sauteing
	- stir frying
- modify recipes
	- avoid foods w/ high saturated fats
	- limit consumption of processed foods

summary

- fats and oils provide flavor, texture, and fullness
- fats function in food as heat transfer medium, emulsifiers, et
- melting point depends on chain length, saturation, and structure
- replace saturated and trans fats with healthier unsaturated fats

### Candy and Chocolate

Classification of candies: two major ways

1. By ingredients
	- syrup phase: sugar with added flavoring
	- fat phase: chocolate or nut paste
2. By preparation phase
	- crystalline phase: smooth and creamy (e.g. fudge)
	- non-crystalline phase (amorphous): hard and chewy (e.g. hard candy, caramel, gummy)

preparation of candy (overview)

1. create syrup solution
2. concetration of contents by heating
3. cooling
4. beating or leaving undisturbed

controlling crystallization of candy is important!!

crystalline candy preparation

1. create syrup solution
	- sugar dissolved in water up to saturation
	- interfering agent added to inhibit large crystal formation (corn syrup or cream of tartar)
2. heating syrup
	- temperature influences crystallization
	- evaporation increases sugar concentration
		- higher temperatures = harder candy forms
		- lower temperatures = softer candy forms
3. cooling and beating
	- cooling: crucial for candy production
	- cool without disturbance to form supersaturated solution
	- beat or stir vigorously
		- promotes formation of many nuclei (seed crystals)
		- forms numerous small crystals

more seed crystals = smaller crystals
fewer seed crystals = larger crystals

non-crystalline candy preparation: ensure sugar doesn't crystallize

1. create very concentrated sugar solution: impedes sugar molecule's movement
2. add large amounts of interfering agents: blocks sugar molecules from clustering together

chocolate

- made from cacao tree beans
- chief ingredient of confections

chocolate production process

1. Fermentation
	- destroy seed coat and kill germs
	- immprove flavor and color
2. drying
3. blending/roasting
4. winnowing: breaks chocolate into small pieces called nibs
5. grinding nibs -> chocolate liquor

after pressing, you can either:

- press the chocolate liquor. Makes cocoa and cocoa butter
- combine with cocoa butter, sugar, and milk (for chocolate milk)
	- mixing
	- refining
	- conching: constant kneading and aeration. increases smoothness, viscosity and flavor
	- add flavor
	- tempering
		- melting, cooling, rewarming
		- promotes small crystal formation
		- smooth texture and stability
		- fully tempered chocolate makes chocolate bloom
	- do either:
		- molding for chocolate bars
		- depositing for chocolate chips

chocolate bloom: grayish discoloration on chocolate surface

- sfae to eat but affects appearance

types of chocolate products

- milk chocolate: >=10% chocolate liquor (FDA)
- white chocolate: no chocolate liquor
- dark chocolate: no FDA standard of identity
	- high antioxidant concentrations (polyphenols)

storage of candy

- store in cool, dry place
- candy products with low water content can be stored longer
- chocolates can be stored up to a year
	- shorter shelf-life for milk and white chocolates
	- fat bloom (temperature), sugar bloom (humidity)

summary

- candies are classified by ingredients and preparation methods
- candy making is 4-step process focusing on sugar crystal formation
- choclate is produced from cocobeans to chocolate liquor to chocolate bars
- proper storage maintains quality of candy

## Food Security

### What is Food Security

Food security definition: all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life (Food and Agriculture Association, 2006)

Food insecurity definition: when a person lacks regular access to enough safe and nutritious food for normal growth and development ad an active and healthy life. May be due to unavailability of food and/or lack of resources to obtain food (FAO, 2023)

Hunger

- uncomfortable/painful physical sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary energy
- individual level psychological condition that may result from food insecurity

elements of food insecurity

- experienced at household and individual levels in different ways
- food supply management and acquisition issues define household situation
- experience of food insecurity is defined by a sequence of events/experiences that can be considered in terms of frequency, duration, and periodicity
- there are graded levels or ranges of food insecurity
- adults compromise their own intakes first, largely to minimize the extent and nature of compromise experienced by children in the household

extent of food insecurity can vary by family member

food security factors

- does the region produce enough food for its people?
- is the food supply stable?
- do physical have physical and economic access to food?

households are classified into one of four categories of food insecurity

1. high food security: no problems, or anxiety about, consistently accessing adequate food
2. marginal food security: had problems or anxiety at times about accessing adequate food. but, quality, variety, and quantity of food was not substantially reduced
3. low food security: households reduced quality, variety, and desirability of diets. quantity of food and normal eating patterns were not substantially disrupted
4. very low food security: at times during the year, eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake reduced because household lacked money or other resources for food

CPS survey: assessing food security is a survey made by the US government to determine food insecurity

#### implications of food insecurity?

food insecurity based on FIES
- uncertainty regarding ability to obtain food
- compromising on food quality and variety
- reducing food quality. skipping meals
- no food for a day or more

moderate food insecurity: person has

- insufficient money/resources for healthy diet
- uncertainty about ability to obtain food
- probably skipped meals or run out of food occasionally

severe food insecurity: person has

- run out of food
- gone an entire day without eating at times during the year

lower food security is associated with higher probability of negative health outcomes such as:

- hypertension
- coronary artery disease
- stroke
- diabetes
- cancer
- asthma
- obesity

### Food Security in the US

who faces hunger in the US?

- hunger can affect ppl from all walks of life

- hunger doesn't affect everyone equally. some groups are more affected than others

factors contributing to food insecurity

- poverty
- unemployment
- low wages
- race/ethnicity
- transportation
- location
- disability

Food deserts: geographic areas where residents' access to affordable, healthy food options are restricted/nonexistent due to absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance

- USDA defines food deserts as low-income census tracts with low access to healthy food. or, residences more than 1 mile away from a grocery store/supermarket in urban areas (or 10-20 miles in rural areas)

food deserts

- areas with high levels of poverty
- lack grocer stores and supermarkets
- other factors include vehicle availability and public transit use
- more likely to be in areas with high minority populations

food deserts often have processed and fast foods that have more unhealthy stuff

health risks in food deserts

- obesity and overweight problems
- nutritional deficiencies
- diabetes
- cardiovascular disease
- high blood pressure
- stroke
- certain types of cancer
- premature death
